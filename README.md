# Rooftop instance segmentation for solar PV potential mapping
This notebook pre-processes a tiff image with corresponding building labels in geoJSON format into slippy map tiles. It then estimates the solar energy-providing potential of each building's roof, using high-resolution drone imagery, together with instance segmentation machine learning algorithms built using Fast.ai and PyTorch.
